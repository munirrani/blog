Computer technologies have always been my forte. As a young 12 year-old child, I used to tinker with the inner workings of computers – desktop, laptop, smartphones and tablets alike — on both hardware and software parts. Casual activities such as installing Android custom ROMs, custom kernels and different desktop operating systems, interacting with computer hobbyists on online forums like XDA Developers, using terminal, compiling software, and writing code, has provided me with a decent technical foundation.

At the age 18 entering university, I also began developing a deep passion in philosophies, religion, history, literatures, business and the social sciences. As a pastime, reading books and listening to podcasts and online discussions around such topics, in tandem with those related to technology and computers, kept me intellectually engaged.

To make active contributions and be directly involved, outside of the university academic scenario I participated in hackathons, tech-related events, giving talks, build side projects and joining organizations.

My inclination on both aspects of technologies, the technicals and the humanities, has led me to believe that successful production and consumption of computer technologies could not be achieved without placing humans as the central focus. With emerging digital technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain and Data Science, such emphasis is needed for the harmonization of these tools in society for the forthcoming future.
